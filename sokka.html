 <p> Sokka is from the Southern Water Tribe. His father is Chief Hakoda and his mother is Kya. During his childhood, Sokka lost his mother during a fire raid. When this happened, Chief Hakoda left the Southern Water tribe in order to fight in the battle against the Fire Nation during the Hundred Years War. Despite his desire to accompany his father and the other water tribe soldiers in battle, Sokka was not permitted to fight because he was too young. Since all the men were fighting the war and there were no other teenage boys living in the village, Sokka was the oldest male in the South Pole, and thus, the leader of the tribe. Sokka, along with his younger sister Katara, was raised by their paternal grandmother who they affectionately call Gran Gran.  Throughout his life, Sokka has been taking care of his village by fishing for food and training kids to become great warriors. He protects his village by using his weapons and fighting skills. His entire life changes when he, and Katara, discover Aang in the iceberg.
