    <p> <a href="https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Avatar the Last Airbender</a> is a well-watched show by both kids and adults for almost 15 years. This series has three seasons that are correlated with each element that Aang, the Avatar, will learn, along with each character Aang meets and befriends. The Avatar is the human embodiment of light, peace, and harmony through the connection with its past lives of the Avatar and the Avatar spirit. These connections enable the Avatar to bend all four elements, including air, water, earth, and fire. After an Avatar's death, it is reincarnated into a bender from the next element of the cycle, thus empowering the Avatar to contact it's past lives. Throughout the series, Aang must train under skilled benders, allowing him to learn and master all four elements in order to accomplish his mission of ending the Hundred Years War. He must attain this goal by defeating Firelord Ozai, and maintaining balance and peace between all the nations of the world. Aang's group of friends will teach Aang how to bend all the elements, and will help him to accomplish his goal! Here you will find all the information about the main characters of this beloved series. This includes learning about each character's early life, their physical appearance, and their mission.
