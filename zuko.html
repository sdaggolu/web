 <p> Zuko is the firstborn prince of Firelord Ozai and Princess Ursa. His paternal great-grandfather,the one who started the Hundred Years War, is Firelord Sozin, and his maternal great-grandfather is the avatar before Aang, Avatar Roku. From a young age, Zuko was disdained by his father. When Zuko was 11 years old, his uncle Iroh’s son was killed during the siege to conquer Ba Sing Se (the Earth Kingdom’s capital). Ozai used Iroh’s weakness and requested an audience with his father, Firelord Azulon, and asked to be heir to the throne instead of his older brother Iroh. Azulon angrily said to Ozai that he should know how it feels to lose a son. That night, Ursa went missing and Azulon’s father died, allowing Ozai to become the Firelord. Zuko was devastated that his mother was gone because she has always supported Zuko in all his endeavors. One day, when he was 13, Zuko sat in a conference room and spoke out when he wasn't supposed to, thus disrespecting his father. Zuko had to face an agni kai (a fire duel), but was unaware that his opponent was his father. During the match, Zuko refused to fight his father and Ozai punished Zuko for his cowardliness by burning Zuko’s face, leaving a scar on his left eye. Zuko was banished and was told that he could return to the throne and regain his honor by capturing the avatar, who was the last airbender.
