<h4>Early Life
</h4>
 <p> Zuko is the firstborn prince of Firelord Ozai and Princess Ursa. His paternal great-grandfather is Sozin, the one who started the Hundred Years War, and his maternal great-grandfather is Avatar Roku, the avatar before Aang. From a young age, Zuko was dsidianed by his father. When Zuko was 11 years old, his uncle Iroh’s son was killed during the siege to conquer Ba Sing Se (the Earth Kingdom’s capital). Ozai used this chance and requested an audience with his father, Firelord Azulon, and asked to be heir to the throne instead of Iroh, who is the first-born. Azulon angrily said to Ozai that he should know how it feels to lose a son. That night, Ursa went missing and Azulon’s father died, allowing Ozai to become the Firelord. One day, when he was 13, Zuko sat in a conference room and spoke out when he wasn't supposed to, thus disrespecting his father. Zuko had to face an agni kai, but was unaware that his opponent was his father. Zuko refused to fight his father and Ozai burned Zuko’s face, leaving a scar on his left eye. Zuko was banished and was told that he could return to the throne and regain his honor by capturing the avatar. </p>

<h4>Appearance
</h4>
<p> Zuko has light skin, hazel eyes, and black hair. Zuko wears a traditional fire prince uniform consisting of red armor. His hair used to be worn in a ponytail and he used to wear the crown, yet got rid of it when his father viewed them as prisoners.  Zuko is 16 years old. </p>

<h4> Mission
</h4>
<p>Zuko has always had a mission to capture Aang in order to restore honor and regain his seat at the throne. However, after time has passed and understanding the facts the Iroh teaches him, Zuko realizes that he must help Aang learn firebending in order to defeat the firelord and maintain peace in the world. Defeating the firelord would also allow Zuko to become heir to the throne. Zuko will accomplish her part in order to help Aang defeat the firelord and save the world!
