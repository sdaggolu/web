 <p> Katara is from the Southern Water Tribe. Her father is Chief Hakoda and her mother is Kya. Katara is the only waterbender from her tribe. During her childhood, Katara lost her mother during a fire raid. During this time, the firebenders wanted to take over all four nations and they attempted to do this by killing many powerful benders. The captain of the fire raid was looking for a waterbender in order to rid the Southern water tribe of any waterbenders. Kya wanted to protect the last waterbender, Katara, and sacrificed her life. The captain, believing Kya is the last waterbender, imprisoned her and sentenced Kya to death. This was a traumatizing moment for Katara. After the death of Kya, Chief Hakoda left the Southern Water tribe in order to fight in the battle against the Fire Nation during the Hundred Years War. Katara, along with her older brother Sokka, was raised by her paternal grandmother who they affectionately call Gran Gran.  Throughout her life, Katara has been taking care of her village by helping Gran Gran with the chores. During her free time, she practices waterbending. Her entire life changes when she, and Sokka, discover Aang in the iceberg. </p>

<p> Katara has black hair, blue eyes, and brown skin. Katara wears a traditional Southern water tribe outfit. She wears a dark blue, kimono-like tunic. Her dress has split sides. This dress is worn over her black leggings. Underneath her dress, she wears a long-sleeved, blue shirt and gray boots. She wears a white fabric belt around her waist. She also wears hair loopies where two locks of the hair from both sides of the head are fastened to the back of the head with blue clips. These hair loopies hang down more loosely than the rest of the hair. Katara’s hair style changes from leaving her air in a braid, to a half-up ponytail, but her hair loopies are always consistent. Katara always wears her mother’s watertribe engagement necklace because it is a token that she remembers her mother by. The necklace consists of a carefully carved pendant in the shape of the water element symbol and is attached to a navy blue ribbon. Katara is 14 years old. </p>
