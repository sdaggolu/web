<h4>Early Life
</h4>
 <p> Katara is from the Southern Water Tribe. Her father is Chief Hakoda and her mother is Kya. Katara is the only waterbender from her tribe. During her childhood, Katara lost her mother during a fire raid. During this time, the firebenders wanted to take over all four nations and they attempted to do this by killing the powerful benders. The captain of the fire raid was looking for a waterbender in order to rid the Southern water tribe of any powerful benders. Kya wanted to protect the last waterbender, Katara. The captain, believing Kya is the last waterbender, imprisoned her and sentenced Kya to death. This was a traumatizing moment for Katara. After a while, Chief Hakoda left the Southern Water tribe in order to fight in the battle against the Fire Nation during the Hundred Years War. Katara, along with her older brother Sokka, was raised by her paternal grandmother who they affectionately call Gran Gran.  Throughout her life, Katara has been taking care of her village by helping Gran Gran with any chores. During her free time, she practices waterbending. Her entire life changes when she, and Sokka, discover Aang in the iceberg. </p>

This dress is worn over trousers. Katara wears black leggings. She also wears hair loopies where two locks of the air from both sides of the head are fastened to the back of the head with clips, hanging down more loosely than the rest of the hair. Katara’s air style changes from leaving her air in a braid, to a half-up, half-down hairstyle, but her hair loopies are always consistent. Katara always wears her mother’s watertribe engagement necklace because it is a token that she remembers her mother by. The necklace consists of a carefully carved pendant in the shape of the water element symbol and is attached to a navy blue ribbon. Katara is 14 years old. </p>
