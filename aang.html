  <h3>Early Life
</h3>
 <p> Aang is from the Southern Air Temple. Aang is raised by Monk Gyatso who is his guardian, figure-figure, and mentor. As an Air Nomad, Aang has traveled broadly around the world. He has visited many nations, cities, and airtemples. One day, Aang and many other airbending boys visited the Eastern Airtemple in order to select a sky bison to be their life-long companion. This is where Aang met Appa, his sky bison and best friend that has been with him through all obstacles. Aang was able to excel at new bending moves he learned. He has proved to be a better airbender than his own teachers. He earned airbending tattoos and an airbending master at the age of 12. Due to signs of war Aang was told he was the avatar at the age of 12 instead of the usual age of 16. He felt anxious about the fact he was the avatar and also felt isolated because many of his airbending friends refused to play with him. The monks required Aang to practice more airbending with them. One day, Aang discovered that he was going to be sent to the Eastern Air Temple so he could be away from Monk Gyatso, whom the other monks thought was too soft on Aang, he could train diligently. Afraid and heartbroken, Aang ran away with Appa and was caught in a storm, allowing them to land in water. Aang saved himself and Appa by entering into the avatar state and freezing them both is an iceberg using a combination of airbending and waterbending. The Avatar State kept Aang alive in the iceberg for a hundred years while the war raged on.

<h3>Appearance
</h3>

<p> Aang wears blue airbending arrow tattoos all around his body. He prefers to shave his head to show the blue arrow on his head. He dresses with a traditional airbending outfit which consists of a pale yellow high-collared shirt with matching yellow pants that is tucked into his maroon boots. He also wears a loose orange shawl, orange wristbands and a matching orange fabric belt. Aang carries his brown wooden staff which can turn into a glider, allowing him to use the air currents to soar across the sky. Though Aang appears like a 12 year old, he is a 122 because he stayed in the iceberg for so long. </p>

<p> Aang is the avatar, master of all four elements: air, water, earth, and fire. Aang is from the Southern Air Temple and he is an air nomad. Though he appears like a 12 year old, Aang is actually 112 years old. As an airbender, Aang has a blue arrow tattoo on his forehead. Aang was told that he was the avatar at the age of 12. When he found out, he was very anxious because he knew the fate of the world lies on his shoulders. One day, he overheard a conversation from the monks and they said that Aang had to leave his home to train somewhere else. Aang was really upset and ran away with his air bison named Appa. They reached the south pole during a rain storm and Aang was stuck in a block of ice. A hundred years later, he was discovered by Katara and Sokka. They are on a mission to defeat the firelord and save the world.
