 <p> Aang was born to two Air nomads and he was taken away shortly after birth. Aang used to live in the Southern Air Temple where he was raised by his guardian and best friends, Monk Gyatso. As an Air Nomad, Aang has traveled extensively around the world. He has visited many nations, cities, and air temples. One day, Aang and many other airbending boys, visited the Eastern Air Temple in order to select a sky bison to be their life-long companion. This is where Aang met Appa, his sky bison and life-long friend. Aang was able to excel at his airbending training. He has proved to be a better airbender than his own teachers. He earned airbending tattoos and was an airbending master at the age of 12. During the reign of Firelord Sozin, he  aimed to expand the Fire nation throughout the world, thus starting a war. Because of this imminent danger, Aang was told that he was the avatar at the age of 12, instead of the usual age of 16. The monks required Aang to train more with them in order to stop the war. Aang felt very anxious about being the avatar because the fate of the world lies on his shoulders. One day, Aang discovered that he was going to be sent to the Eastern Air Temple so he could be away from Monk Gyatso, whom the other monks thought was too soft on Aang, in order to train effectively and diligently. Saddened and afraid, Aang ran away with Appa and, soon, was caught in a storm, allowing them to land in water. Aang saved himself and Appa by entering into the avatar state and freezing them both in an iceberg using a combination of airbending and waterbending. The avatar state is a defense mechanism which is designed to empower Aang with the skills of the past avatar. It is the state where Aang’s eyes and tattoos glow because it channels the energy of all the past avatars through the body. The Avatar State kept Aang alive in the iceberg for a hundred years while the Hundred Years War raged on.

 <p> Aang has light skin and gray eyes. Aang wears blue airbending arrow tattoos all around his body. He prefers to shave his head to proudly show the blue arrow on his head. In addition, a shaved head is necessary in allowing airbenders to swiftly move along the air currents. He wears a traditional airbending outfit which consists of a pale yellow high-collared shirt with matching yellow pants that is tucked into his maroon boots. He also wears a loose orange shawl, orange wristbands and a matching orange fabric belt. Aang carries his brown wooden staff which can turn into a glider, allowing him to use the air currents to soar across the sky. Though Aang appears like a 12 year old, he is actually 122 years old because he stayed in the iceberg for a hundred years. </p>

  <p>The Hundred Years war left a devastating impact on the whole world, affecting the balance of power between the four nations. The Fire nation has been growing more powerful as it continues to expand under the reign of Firelord Ozai. After Aang got caught up in a storm and was hidden in the iceberg for a hundred years, he was discovered by Katara and Sokka in the South Pole. Once realizing the catastrophic results of his disappearance, Aang’s mission is to defeat Firelord Ozai and restore balance in the world. He trains for this ultimate battle by learning to successfully bend all four elements: air, water, earth, and fire, in order to protect all the nations from the clutches of Firelord Ozai. With help from his team of friends, Aang diligently trains under them in order to accomplish his mission and save the world!
