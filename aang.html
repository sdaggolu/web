<p> Aang is the avatar, master of all four elements: air, water, earth, and fire. Aang is from the Southern Air Temple and he is an air nomad. Though he appears like a 12 year old, Aang is actually 112 years old. As an airbender, Aang has a blue arrow tattoo on his forehead. Aang was told that he was the avatar at the age of 12. When he found out, he was very anxious because he knew the fate of the world lies on his shoulders. One day, he overheard a conversation from the monks and they said that Aang had to leave his home to train somewhere else. Aang was really upset and ran away with his air bison named Appa. They reached the south pole during a rain storm and Aang was stuck in a block of ice. A hundred years later, he was discovered by Katara and Sokka. They are on a mission to defeat the firelord and save the world.
