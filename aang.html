  Aang is from the Southern Air Temple. Aang was raised by Monk Gyatso who is his guardian, father-figure, and mentor. As an Air Nomad, Aang has traveled extensively around the world. He has visited many nations, cities, and airtemples. One day, Aang and many other airbending boys visited the Eastern Air Temple in order to select a sky bison to be their life-long companion. This is where Aang met Appa, his sky bison and life-long best friend. Aang was able to excel at his airbending training. He has proved to be a better airbender than his own teachers. He earned airbending tattoos and was an airbending master at the age of 12. Due to signs of war, which was caused by the Fire Nation, Aang was told he was the avatar at the age of 12 instead of the usual age of 16. The monks required Aang to train more with them in order to stop the war. He felt anxious about the fact he was the avatar who is meant to save the world, and also felt isolated because he was different from his airbending friends and everyone else in the world. One day, Aang discovered that he was going to be sent to the Eastern Air Temple so he could be away from Monk Gyatso, whom the other monks thought was too soft on Aang, in order to train effectively and diligently. Afraid and heartbroken, Aang ran away with Appa and was caught in a storm, allowing them to land in water. Aang saved himself and Appa by entering into the avatar state and freezing them both in an iceberg using a combination of airbending and waterbending. The avatar state is a defense mechanism which is designed to empower Aang, with the skills of the past avatar. It is the state where Aang’s eyes and tattoos glow which channels the energy of all the past avatars through the body. The Avatar State kept Aang alive in the iceberg for a hundred years while the war raged on.

<p> Aang wears blue airbending arrow tattoos all around his body. He prefers to shave his head to show the blue arrow on his head and a shaved head allows airbenders to swiftly move along with the air currents. He dresses with a traditional airbending outfit which consists of a pale yellow high-collared shirt with matching yellow pants that is tucked into his maroon boots. He also wears a loose orange shawl, orange wristbands and a matching orange fabric belt. Aang carries his brown wooden staff which can turn into a glider, allowing him to use the air currents to soar across the sky. Though Aang appears like a 12 year old, he is actually 122 years old because he stayed in the iceberg for a hundred years.
