  <p> Toph is a blind earthbender who uses that weakness to her advantage by feeling the vibrations of the earth. She ran away from her parents because she wanted to teach Aang earthbending. She was a pampered girl who was hidden away from society because her parents never let her go outside in public. However, she was secretly raised as a earthbending tournament fighter and she has been a winner in all these championships until Aang arrived and asked her to teach him earthbending.
