  <p> Toph is from the Gaoling city in the Earth Kingdom. Her full name is Toph Beifong. Toph is the only child of the Beifong family. Born blind, she is raised by her parents and concealed from the world. Her parents believe that her blindness makes her incapable of taking care of herself. Nobody knew that Toph existed and she was expected to be well-mannered due to her noble status. As a result, Toph resents the way her parents raised her as a child. One day, when she was young, Toph ran away from home and hid in a cave that was filled with badgermoles. She copied the badgermoles' movements through the vibrations she felt from the ground, and through her sense of hearing, enabling her to learn earthbending. Her blindness allowed Toph to develop patience and keen hearing, thus allowing her to become a powerful earthbender. Toph's father hired an earthbending master, Master Yu, to instruct her. Her father ordered Master Yu to only teach her beginner moves. However, she secretly trained to become a master earthbender and fought in an underground earthbending competition, known as the Earth Rumble. Her fighting title was the Blind Bandit and she has been an Earth Rumble champion for many years. Her entire life changes when Aang finds her in an Earth Rumble tournament.
